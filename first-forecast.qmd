# First forecast: Introduction to NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge {#sec-first-forecast}

This module was developed by Olsson, F., C. Boettiger, C.C. Carey, M.E. Lofton, and R.Q. Thomas

[Tutorial](https://github.com/OlssonF/NEON-forecast-challenge-workshop)

This tutorial introduces participants to key concepts in ecological forecasting and provides hands-on materials for submitting forecasts to the Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI) - National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Forecasting Challenge (hereafter, Challenge). The tutorial has been developed and used with more than 300 participants in both classrooms and workshops and provides the ecological understanding, workflows, and tools to enable ecologists with minimal forecasting experience to participate in the Challenge via a hands-on code-based tutorial. This R-based tutorial introduces participants to a near-term, iterative forecasting workflow that includes obtaining observations from NEON, developing a simple forecasting model, generating a forecast, and submitting the forecast to the Challenge, as well as analyzing forecast performance once new observations become available for evaluation. The overarching aim of this tutorial is to lower the barrier to ecological forecasting and empower participants to continue to innovate and develop their own ecological forecasts for the Challenge into the future.

The assignment will require you to create a GitHub repository with your completed code from the NEON Forecasting Challenge workshop. You will build on this repository throughout the rest of section 1 of the book. You can learn more about setting up Git and GitHub in @sec-github.

You will be generating forecasts of water temperature at NEON aquatics sites.
